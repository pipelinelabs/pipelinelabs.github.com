Licensed under the [MIT License][0]\r\n\r\n> free, open-source  \r\n> Continuous Delivery tool  \r\n> that's simple to use for hobbyists,  \r\n> flexible enough for startups  \r\n> and powerful enough for the enterprise\r\n\r\nFind the latest release on the [releases][6] page. And follow the [installation][8] and [configuration][9] documentation to get started.\r\n\r\nState of the project\r\n--------------------\r\nThis project is currently in a very early state of development. Development happens in a LEAN way, bit by bit adding features and improving based on user experiences and feedback. Give your feedback at the [user/dev forum][3].\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n--------\r\n- From the ground-up, pipeline-based\r\n- Pipeline configuration in pipeline domain language (DSL)\r\n- Version controlled pipeline configuration\r\n- Support for public and private git repositories\r\n    - hosted on [Github](http://github.com), triggered via [webhook][7]\r\n\r\nResources\r\n---------\r\n- Pipeline Homepage -- http://pipelinelabs.org\r\n- GitHub Organization -- http://github.pipelinelabs.org\r\n- Documentation -- http://docs.pipelinelabs.org\r\n- User/Dev Forum -- [http://forum.pipelinelabs.org][3]\r\n- Issue Tracker -- http://issues.pipelinelabs.org\r\n\r\nFollow us on Twitter [@pipelinelabs](https://twitter.com/pipelinelabs)\r\n\r\nIf you have any ideas, comments or questions, please direct them to the [user/dev forum][3].\r\nAll feedback is appreciated!\r\n\r\n### Presentations\r\n- Ignite talk \"Continuous Integration and Delivery tools, do we really like using them?\"\r\n    - [Preparation run recording][4]\r\n    - [@DevOpsDays Amsterdam, June 14th 2013 recording][5]\r\n\r\nRoadmap\r\n-------\r\nSome ideas on epics/topics we want to have implemented along the way, in no particular order:\r\n\r\n- Configuration service that provides generic configuration to all pipelines\r\n    - Also supporting a secure way for sensitive configuration data\r\n- Native packages for different OS'es, for easy installation\r\n    - Also providing scripts to run services as system daemons/services\r\n- Extensive logging and monitoring functionality\r\n- Extend pipeline configuration with environment and execution information for simpler maintenance by not depending on specific server configurations, the pipeline takes care of everything in a versioned manner. For example:\r\n    - Environment variables to make available to the whole pipeline, specific stages or specific commands\r\n    - System applications and versions which are required to run the pipeline are installed and configured automatically\r\n    - ...\r\n- Different GUI's, for the different types of users and usages\r\n    - All communicating with one single API against the system\r\n- Support for different authentication and authorization schemes\r\n\r\nBuilding Pipeline\r\n--------------\r\nThe only prerequisite is that you have JDK 7 or higher installed.\r\n\r\nAfter cloning the project, type `./gradlew clean build` (Windows: `gradlew clean build`). All build dependencies,\r\nincluding [Gradle](http://www.gradle.org) itself, will be downloaded automatically (unless already present).\r\n\r\nContributing\r\n------------\r\nFeel free to contribute! Follow these steps:\r\n\r\nFirst time only:\r\n\r\n- Fork the repo (`upstream`) to your GitHub account (`origin`).\r\n- Clone `origin` as your `local` repo\r\n\r\nEvery other time:\r\n\r\n- Update both `origin` and `local` repos from `upstream`\r\n- Create new branch for a feature or bug fix\r\n- Commit often :)\r\n- Once when work is done, push local changes to your `origin`\r\n- Send us a pull request (PR)\r\n\r\nWe will pickup up from there :)\r\n\r\nSpecial thanks to\r\n-----------------\r\n- [Andrew Oberstar](http://www.andrewoberstar.com) for being the very first code contributor and all-round providing great support and feedback\r\n- [Martin Kovachki](http://www.linkedin.com/in/martinkov) for awesome logo designs\r\n- [Tricode](http://www.tricode.nl) for sponsoring developer-time and resources\r\n\r\n\r\n[0]: http://github.pipelinelabs.org/blob/master/LICENSE\r\n[3]: http://forum.pipelinelabs.org\r\n[4]: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=shF_v5shzjU\r\n[5]: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-StobwMgRNE\r\n[6]: https://github.com/pipelinelabs/pipeline/releases\r\n[7]: https://help.github.com/articles/post-receive-hooks\r\n[8]: http://docs.pipelinelabs.org/User-Guide%3A-Set-up-with-Central-Repository\r\n[9]: http://docs.pipelinelabs.org/User-Guide%3A-Project-Pipeline-Configuration","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
